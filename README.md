# SpotifyAdBlocker
This is a very simple application that mutes spotify ads by muting the master volume of the application when an ad is playing and unmuting it when the ad finishes

# Usage
When you open the application, it will prompt you with a few setup questions and then it will run in the background. It takes very little CPU usage and very little ram as well. I've added the Verson 1 .exe file into the repository, and if you want you are welcome to download it. The code that is in the repository is what is in the .exe, and nothing else has been added. If you don't trust me you can download the file and make it an executable yourself, it's not that hard. Thanks :)

*The .exe file is fixed and it is in the folder. Download the one that says correct version on it, not the other one
