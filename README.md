# SpotifyAdBlocker
This is a very simple application that mutes spotify ads by muting the master volume of the application when an ad is playing and unmuting it when the ad finishes

# Usage
When you open the application, it will prompt you with a few setup questions and then it will run in the background. It takes very little CPU usage and very little ram as well. As of right now I don't have the .exe file but I will put it on here as soon as I do
